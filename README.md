## About me

I am a Brazilian philosopher pursuing a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Missouri and a PhD in Logic at Unicamp. I hold a BSc in Physics and two Master’s degrees in Philosophy (Unicamp, 2020; University of Missouri, 2024). Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant and Graduate Instructor for the Department of Philosophy of the University of Missouri, teaching introductory courses in Logic and Philosophy.

My ongoing research focuses on formal characterizations of explanatory virtues. One of my main interests is in understanding the relationship between explanatory power, simplicity, and consilience, and how they contribute to in explanatory reasoning. I have recently presented my project at the PSA Conference and have four working papers on this topic. One of these papers employs an agent-based model to compare probabilistic measures of explanatory virtues to understand how each measure performs as a guide to inference.

Previously, I did some work on formal logic and the problem of evil. Back then, I engaged with first-order modal systems to give an account of particular issues involving the charge of religious determinism to theism, as part of a larger project on formal tools in philosophy of religion. This research led to a number of published papers and helped me shape even more my appreciation for formal methods in philosophy, which was crucial to the steps I’m currently pursuing in my PhD research.

I have recently written a popular-level book in Portuguese where I discuss how the philosophy of scientific explanation sheds light on important debates in the science and religion interface. The book is the result of a contest from a Templeton-funded project in my home country, and should be published in 2025. I have contributed to public conversations about science, religion, and philosophy in several ways over the years in Brazil, and I hope this book will be helpful in contributing to those debates even further.

Besides work, I enjoy reading Brazilian and Portuguese literature, fantasy, and non-fiction books, watching travel channels, playing guitar, and spending time with my wife.
